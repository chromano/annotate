{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
Enter the text you want to annotate.

Currently ignoring the title and slug. Just put it there because it seems like a good idea for the future.
<form method="post" class="form-horizontal">{% csrf_token %}
    {{ form }}
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
</form>
{% endblock %}
