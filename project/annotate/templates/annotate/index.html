                            Children's books are great because they provide a lot of repetition,
                            generally simple sentence structure, and mirror actual daily
                            usage patterns more than most textbook studies.<br><br>
                            Side by side annotation (like this note) keep comments, definitions,
                            grammatical pattern explanations, etc near the actual reference
                            text and makes learning more efficient.

                            often be dense and difficult to understand, especially when examining

                            Side by side annotation is very useful for tying the code to the author's
                            intent as they were writing that code.
